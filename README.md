This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Ruby related to directly manipulating instance variables from outside their defining class. The example shows how using `instance_variable_set` can bypass the intended object behavior, potentially leading to unexpected results and making code harder to maintain. The solution showcases better approaches to managing object state, promoting encapsulation and better code organization.
